I've successfully deployed the complete CRADA ETL infrastructure on AWS, with all components now operational. The dual-pathway system is ready: the daily batch process for data ingestion and the on-demand API endpoint for real-time operational needs. All AWS components (Glue jobs, S3 staging bucket, Redshift cluster, Lambda functions, and API Gateway) are functioning correctly, with ETL scripts uploaded and configured. The next steps include establishing the MHS Genesis database connection, integrating Tableau with our Redshift cluster, and conducting thorough end-to-end testing of both data pathways. I'll need assistance from Analytics to establish connectivity with MHS Genesis and Tableau.
